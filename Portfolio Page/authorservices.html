        <p> Hey there. I'm Masha. 22. I'm a Muslimah who adores books. Also an avid reader, writer, polyglot... and many more.</p>

        <h2>Let me polish your draft for you!</h2>
        <img src="https://mashareadshome.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/beige-minimalist-beauty-linkedin-banner.png?w=1024" 
        
        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Masha. I have always been an avid reader and my love for books know no bounds. I began noticing error in printed books during my high school years. As I read more and more books over the years, my sharpness in noticing errors increased tenfold. <br> <br>

            In 2018, I began writing my first book. After months of writing the first draft, I began editing. That was when I realised the errors I didnâ€™t even notice while writing. Editing is a crucial part of the job for us writers even though it comes with a lot of pain and anguish. Editing has made me realise a lot of things. There is nothing like a â€˜perfectâ€™ draft. Every draft must undergo heavy editing in order to give it a smooth finish. <br> <br>
            
            Now, I find errors in the many books I read even though Iâ€™m reading for fun. I have a blog where I write about the books I read and also another blog about my writing journey. Over the years, I have taught myself full editing and proofreading and Iâ€™d like to help you polish that manuscript you have spent hours on. <br> <br>
            
            I have a Bachelorâ€™s in Management from the University of Greenwich and a Masters in Business Admin. Aside from freelance proofreading, I also give advice regarding SEO and do some translations from Elementary Spanish to English, Hausa to English and English to Hausa. <br> <br>
            
            I am an avid reader of a wide range of genres. Hence, I am very familiar with Horror, Mystery, Thriller, Psychological Thriller, Historical Fiction, Womenâ€™s Fiction, YA, Paranormal, and Contemporary. Rom-Coms are also fine. I have a lot of experience with them. <br> <br><br>
         
            
            I can do basic editing, proofreading, line editing, ghostwritng and beta-reading. I can also critique, provide constructive feedback, and give my advice and opinions. <br> <br>
